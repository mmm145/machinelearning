    "- small data set for learning\n",
    "  - size of data set can be small thanks to the inductive bias\n",

    "  - Inductive bias provides the more accurate prediction on unknown data, especially the unknown data can be created based on Inductive bias.\n",

    "- prior integration of knowledge.\n",
    "  - Inductive bias can include the knowledge that is unique to the specific task and filed, which leads to the more accurate prediction and efficitnet training.\n",

    "### inductive bias and LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM is usually used by transformers, which means it has a few inductive bias.\n",
    "=> LLM needs a large amount of data to predict accurately enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "the larger the data set, the better transformer performs,\n",
