# def

- unsupervised
- hard clustering
  - why, you can know exact clusters that each point will be in.

# motivation 

- you wanna know the group in data


# Algorithm 

- 1. randomly cluster the points into 2 groups
- 2. get the center of each groups.  mean of each 
- 3. get the distance between each point and center of the cluster. 
- 4. compare the closeness and chante the cluster based on that.  

# metric for clustering

**variance between group**

**variance within group**


### implementation for clustering.

```{r}
plot(faithful)
```

```{r}
num_of_group <- 2

(groups <- sample(num_of_group, nrow(faithful), TRUE))

(centers <- sapply(faithful, tapply, groups, mean))

(groups <- max.col(-apply(centers, 1, \(x) colSums( t(faithful) - x )^2)))

plot(faithful, col= groups)
```

```{r}

plot(faithful, col = groups)
faithful

```
```{r}


```
